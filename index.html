        <h3>A post-partisan business helping other businesses, entrepreneurs, and community groups leverage technological change to connect with their audiences.</h3>
      <p>More than ever, having an online digital identity and presence is one of the biggest determining factors to economic opportunity and mobility.</p>

<p>The success of entrepreneurs and small businesses depends on being able to meet customers where they are, and providing them with the value they are seeking.</p>

<p>For better or for worse, those customers are increasingly spending their time and money online – meaning, you also need to be online if you hope to beat out or join the competition.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for many small businesses in already marginalized communities, this is still far out of reach.      </p>

<p>Necessity breeds innovation — but this is only possible in a system that provides sufficient access to the tools, resources, and stewardship to implement ideas into reality.
